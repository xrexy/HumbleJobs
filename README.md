# HumbleJobs

<h3>Discontinued project.</h3>

<p>HumbleJobs is a plugin that lets the server owner create custom jobs, limited only by their imagination.</p>

<ul>
  <li>By editting jobs.yml the administrator can create different jobs, in the section of the event he wishes to use. (Note: not all sections are implemented)
  <li>All the events are seperated into different sections, if no job is registed to that event it is not registered, decreasing the plugin's impact on server performance</li>
</ul>
